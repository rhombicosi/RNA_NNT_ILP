## CODE FILES
**prepro_run.py**

executes several commands to prepare reference structures to test loop-decomposition milp model 

**prepro_utils.py**

functions to preprocess .seq and .ct files, create folders and writing results to files

**constant_paths.py**

initiates names and paths to folders:

*arch_rel_path* -- path to ARCHIVE II directory of all references

*badfiles_dir* -- folder to store .seq files that do not have corresponding .ct structures, not useful for testing

*seq_len_dir*  -- directory to store sequences of size less or equal to {seq_len}

*ct_len_dir*  -- directory to store structures of sequences of size less or equal to {seq_len}

*lp_folder_name* -- folder to store models as .lp files

*sol_folder_name* --  folder to store solutions .sol files

*dot_bracket_folder_name* -- folder to store solutions in dot-bracket format

*dot_bracket_archive_folder_name* -- folder to store archive reference structures in dot-bracket format

*rnastructure_folder_name* -- folder to store structures .ct files ganerated by RNAstructure algorithm

*dot_bracket_rnastructure_folder_name* -- folder to store RNAstructure structures in dot-bracket format

*efn2_archive_folder_name* -- folder with .txt files with energies calculated with RNAstructure software for archive reference structures

*rnastruct_path* -- path to "RNAstructure6.5/exe" execution files

## HOW TO RUN THE CODE 

1. Prepare archive II data folder and store it to the code relative path '../../ARCHIVE II/'

2. Run prepro_run.py to initialize all folder names, paths and to prepare files for testing and references in correct format.

2. Run store_results.py to solve the ILP model and store the results in *ilp_results.txt*
